# ðŸš€ Torrent Streaming Fixes Applied

## Problems Fixed:

### 1. **MKV Files Stuck at 0% Download**
- **Cause**: Large file size requirements (50MB minimum) excluded some MKV files
- **Fix**: Reduced minimum file size to 10MB and added fallback selection
- **Enhancement**: Deselecting non-target files to focus bandwidth on the video file

### 2. **MP4 Files Stuck at 1% Streaming**
- **Cause**: Overly strict data requirements before starting FFmpeg (5MB minimum)
- **Fix**: Reduced to 2MB minimum with more flexible conditions
- **Enhancement**: Start FFmpeg with any reasonable amount of data (50KB+)

### 3. **Additional Improvements**
- **Torrent Health Monitoring**: Detects stalled downloads and attempts recovery
- **Better File Selection**: More flexible video file detection
- **Enhanced FFmpeg**: Added flags for better streaming compatibility
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows which specific files are downloading

## Key Changes:

### `torrentService.js`:
- âœ… Reduced `waitForFileData` minimum from 5MB to 2MB
- âœ… Added 60-second timeout with fallback to available data
- âœ… Deselect non-target files to focus bandwidth
- âœ… Enhanced download progress tracking per file
- âœ… Added torrent health check with stall detection

### `ffmpegService.js`:
- âœ… Added FFmpeg flags for better streaming: `-fflags +genpts`, `-movflags +faststart`
- âœ… Set stream as ready at 10% FFmpeg progress instead of 100%
- âœ… Better error handling and fallback to re-encoding

### File Selection:
- âœ… Reduced minimum file size from 50MB to 10MB
- âœ… Fallback to any video file if no large files found
- âœ… Better detection of video formats including MKV

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Test with MKV**: Try a torrent with MKV files - should now download
2. **Test with MP4**: Should start streaming much faster (at ~2MB downloaded)
3. **Monitor Health**: Check console for health check messages every 10 seconds
4. **Stall Recovery**: If download stalls, system will attempt automatic recovery

## Expected Behavior:
- **MKV Downloads**: Should start immediately and show progress
- **MP4 Streaming**: Should begin within 30-60 seconds of download start  
- **Progress Tracking**: More detailed per-file progress information
- **Stall Detection**: Automatic detection and recovery attempts

The system is now much more aggressive about starting playback early and more resilient to torrent issues!
